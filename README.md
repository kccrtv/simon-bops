# Simon Bops

### Project 1 for General Assembly's remote Software Engineering Immersive program

> Simon Bops is a remix of the iconic Hasbro memory game with a vintage Bop It! UI. The game is a test of memory, with the computer (aka Simon) generating a random sequence of colors, which the user will attempt to match.

# Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles

CSS Grid wasn't covered at this point of the course, so it took a lot of trial, error, and helpful YouTube videos to get the piece overlapping in a way that matched my wireframe. I wanted to implement animations to simulate the Bop It! game. I tried a couple of different CSS animation libraries, but after breaking my code a few times, I stuck it out with the helpful folks at animate.css and was able to overcome that hurdle. The JS is as DRY as I could make it, with lots of learning on semi-new method concepts such as Promises and Audio.
