Create a bronze, silver, and gold plan. This is your first project and you don't have a good way to estimate how long individual tasks will take, so it's better to set the bar low. There's no problem with under-promising and over-delivering! You can always add more features if time allows. However, if you focus on non-MVP features before your MVP is complete and run out of time, your submission will not satisfy the project requirements.
